Description: An adaptation of the multi-variable stochastic weather generator proposed in 'Rglimclim' to perform gap-filling and temporal extension at sub-daily resolution. Simulation is performed based on large scale variables and climatic observation data that could be generated from different gauged stations having geographical proximity. SWG relies on reanalyses. Multi-variable dependence is taking into account by using the decomposition of the product rule (in statistics) into conditional probabilities. See <https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02554676>.
